Revison 1.2 Notes
------------------
0) SPI MISO/MOSI D11/D12 reversed!!!
1) Remove Ground Strap Hole, it was confusing to the assemblers
2) Remove 3.3V solder jumper it was confusing to the assemblers
3) Extend rear dimension of PCB and switch to 90 deg (Right Angle) Grove Connectors.
4) Correct UART Silksreen error (RX/TX printed names are reversed, the signals are okay)
5) Swap !RTS(D17) with !DTR(D20) to correct PWM pin assignment error
6) Add J3 (Analog) Grove Connector for Analog sensors, uses A0 & D9
7) Add silkscreen box/legend for J4/J5 for clarity about connector placement
